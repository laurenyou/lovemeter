		<div id="body">
			<p><b>what is it?</b></p>
			<p>Love Meter aims to give people an estimation of how well their love relationships can turn out. The heartbeat in the background changes color and size depending on the likelihood of a successful relationship and this counselling experience is further enhanced by the complementary music.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="body2">
			<p><b>why Love Meter?</b></p>
			<p>Sometimes people just spend too much time thinking about their crush without taking any action. Love Meter is designed to give people an easy answer and help them decide whether or not to initiate something, continue with their current relationship, or abandon it because it's going nowhere.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="body3">
			<p><b>how was it made?</b></p>
			<p>Love Meter is powered by an API named Love Calculator, which returns a percentage along with a comment for each ajax request that is made. The particles and heartbeat made of triangles in the background are drawn using p5 library. The songs are from Youtube and have been edited using Audacity. I used Google as the main resource to understand why my code wasn't working at times and my professor Craig Protzel also helped with debugging.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="body4">
			<p><b>what feedback was received?</b></p>
			<p>Initially, I only had the wedding march play for 99% and above but many people suggested that the other percentages should have something as well. I hid their advice and added more songs for the lower percentages. I spent quite a lot of time trying to decide which songs to use because I wanted the lyrics to make sense and support the results.</p>
		</div> 

		<div id="body5">
			<p><b>what lessons were learned?</b></p>
			<p>I learned how to use the different p5 libraries and the ways in which I can incorporate them in my webpage to make it visually pleasing. Specifically, I gained new knowledge about the use of functions, the logic behind 'if and else' statements, and the difference between what should go in setup() and draw(). I also found trial and error to be the most effective way of learning the language.</p>
